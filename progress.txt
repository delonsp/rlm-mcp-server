# Progress Log - RLM MCP Server Test Suite

Este arquivo registra o progresso do Ralph em cada iteração.

---

## Iteration 1 - Add pytest and pytest-asyncio to pyproject.toml

- What was implemented:
  - Added `[project.optional-dependencies]` section with `dev` group
  - Added pytest>=8.0.0 and pytest-asyncio>=0.24.0 as dev dependencies
  - Added `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` section with asyncio configuration

- Files changed:
  - pyproject.toml

- Learnings for future iterations:
  - pytest-asyncio requires `asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope` config to avoid deprecation warning
  - Dev dependencies go in `[project.optional-dependencies]` section in modern pyproject.toml
  - Install with `pip install -e ".[dev]"` to get dev dependencies
  - pytest config can be added in `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` section
  - Setting `asyncio_mode = "auto"` makes async tests easier (no need for @pytest.mark.asyncio)

---

## Iteration 2 - Create tests/ directory with __init__.py

- What was implemented:
  - Created tests/ directory
  - Created tests/__init__.py with minimal header comment

- Files changed:
  - tests/__init__.py (new file)

- Learnings for future iterations:
  - pytest exit code 5 means "no tests collected" - this is expected for empty test suite
  - pytest correctly discovers the tests/ directory as a package

---

## Iteration 3 - Create tests/conftest.py with fixtures

- What was implemented:
  - Created tests/conftest.py with temp_db and sample_text fixtures
  - temp_db: Creates temporary SQLite .db file, cleans up after test
  - sample_text: Generates ~1.45M chars with Portuguese terms (medo, ansiedade, trabalho, etc.)
  - Added tests/test_fixtures.py to validate fixtures work correctly

- Files changed:
  - tests/conftest.py (new file)
  - tests/test_fixtures.py (new file)
  - PRD.md (marked task complete)

- Learnings for future iterations:
  - tempfile.mkstemp returns (file_descriptor, path) - must close fd before using path
  - sample_text of ~1.45M chars is well above the 100k threshold for auto-indexing
  - Fixtures in conftest.py are automatically discovered by pytest without imports

---

## Iteration 4 - Test save_variable and load_variable roundtrip

- What was implemented:
  - Created tests/test_persistence.py with TestSaveAndLoadVariable class
  - 10 test cases covering:
    - Roundtrip for string, dict, list types
    - Empty values (empty string, dict, list)
    - Nonexistent variable returns None
    - Variable with metadata
    - Overwriting existing variable
    - Large string (~1.45M chars) with compression

- Files changed:
  - tests/test_persistence.py (new file)
  - PRD.md (marked task complete)
  - progress.txt

- Learnings for future iterations:
  - PersistenceManager(db_path=temp_db) accepts custom path for testing
  - save_variable returns True on success, uses pickle + zlib compression
  - load_variable returns None if variable doesn't exist (not an exception)
  - INSERT OR REPLACE handles overwriting with same name
