# Progress Log - RLM MCP Server Test Suite

Este arquivo registra o progresso do Ralph em cada iteração.

## Iteration 1 - Add pytest and pytest-asyncio to pyproject.toml

- What was implemented:
  - Added `[project.optional-dependencies]` section with `dev` group
  - Added pytest>=8.0.0 and pytest-asyncio>=0.24.0 as dev dependencies
  - Added `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` section with asyncio configuration

- Files changed:
  - pyproject.toml

- Learnings for future iterations:
  - pytest-asyncio requires `asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope` config to avoid deprecation warning
  - Dev dependencies go in `[project.optional-dependencies]` section in modern pyproject.toml
  - Install with `pip install -e ".[dev]"` to get dev dependencies
  - pytest config can be added in `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` section
  - Setting `asyncio_mode = "auto"` makes async tests easier (no need for @pytest.mark.asyncio)

---

## Iteration 2 - Create tests/ directory with __init__.py

- What was implemented:
  - Created tests/ directory
  - Created tests/__init__.py with minimal header comment

- Files changed:
  - tests/__init__.py (new file)

- Learnings for future iterations:
  - pytest exit code 5 means "no tests collected" - this is expected for empty test suite
  - pytest correctly discovers the tests/ directory as a package
